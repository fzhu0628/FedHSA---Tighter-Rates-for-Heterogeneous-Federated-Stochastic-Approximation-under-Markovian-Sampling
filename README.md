# Achieving Tighter Finite-Time Rates for Heterogeneous Federated Stochastic Approximation under Markovian Sampling
## Overview
- This is my second paper for the pursuit of my PhD degree.
- This paper has been submitted to NeuRIPS 2025.
- About this paper
  - Recall that in my last paper _Towards Fast Rates for Federated and Multi Task Reinforcement Learning_, we focused on heterogeneous FRL problems with _polcy-iteration_ methods, policy gradient methods to be precise.
  - We propose _**FedHSA**_, an algorithm designed for _value-iteration_ methods in heterogeneous FRL settings, compensenting for the previous paper in FRL algorithms.
